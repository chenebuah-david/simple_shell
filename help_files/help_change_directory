cd: cd
    	Change the shell working directory.

   	Change the current directory to DIR.  The default DIR is the value of the
    	HOME shell variable.

	The variable `CDPATH` specifies the search path for locating the directory
	specified by `DIR`. The directory names in `CDPATH` are separated by a colon (:).

	When searching for `DIR`, if a directory name in `CDPATH` is null (empty),
	it represents the current directory. However, if `DIR` begins with a slash (/),
	the `CDPATH` variable is not utilized in the search process.

Exit Status:
   	Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when
    	-P is used; non-zero otherwise.
